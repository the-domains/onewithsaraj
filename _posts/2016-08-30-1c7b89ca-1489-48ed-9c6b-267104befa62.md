This statement is worth spending time with. It tells a great amount about Truth, and it does it in as helpful way as it possibly can.

For as long as there has been recorded history, there have been individuals who attempted to notify others, of the way to thrive in this world. There are so many, many paths presented for one to take, to cultivate understanding of how this all works, and how to navigate this adventure as unscathed as possible. I've spent an innumerable moments of "time" sifting, contemplating, resonating, thru volumes and experiences of paved paths, to get to where ...I AM TODAY.
